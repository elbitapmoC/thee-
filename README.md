# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.


# Github Instructions

1. **Make Your Changes**:

   - Edit, add, or delete files in your project as needed. After making changes, stage the modified files and commit them to your new branch:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
     ```

2. **Push the Changes to Your Fork**:

   - Push the changes in your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin new-feature-branch
     ```

3. **Open a Pull Request**:

   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub, and click on the "Compare & pull request" button.
   - Make sure you're comparing your branch with the original repository's main branch.
   - Add a title and description of your changes, then click "Create pull request."

4. **Review and Discussion**:
   - Wait for feedback from the repository maintainers. They might ask for some adjustments or approve your pull request.
